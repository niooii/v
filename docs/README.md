# V Engine Documentation

C++23 ECS-heavy voxel engine.

## Quick Start

```bash
./v build              # Build all
./v targets            # List available targets
./v run [target]       # Run target (fuzzy searched)
./v test               # Run tests
```

## Architecture

- **Engine**: The ECS orchestrator, also an entity itself. This lets us request components from systems that are owned by the Engine.  
- **Contexts**: Singleton services (RenderContext, WindowContext, etc.)
- **Domains**: Can be a system, a component, or an entity, or some combination of the three, depending on the usage and your design choices.
- **Components**: Raw data, or a collection of callbacks distributed by some system.

Design heavily inspired by my GOAT [John Lin](Inspired by [Object-Oriented ECS Design](https://voxely.net/blog/object-oriented-entity-component-system-design/)

## Ok so, where engine?

The engine provides the following default contexts:  

TODO add links here  
Async  - Provides threading and coroutines  
Net    - Provides network communication via UDP
Render - Provides everything rendering related
Window - Provides windows and per-window input
SDL    - Provides access to low level SDL events
