# v

Rewrite of the engine I wrote for my [gamedev final project](https://github.com/niooii/gdfe), intended to render voxels.  

**This project is still in it's beginning phases**, very much WIP.  

## Building
### Linux and Windows
Use the `v.py` script (and it's aliases), a utility script to build various targets in the project. 

## Profiling
Only tracy GUI release 0.12.2 was tested.
