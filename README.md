# v

Rewrite of the engine I wrote for my [gamedev final project](https://github.com/niooii/gdfe), intended to render voxels.  

**This project is still in it's beginning phases**, very much WIP.  

## Building
### Linux
If you're on linux, you can use the `v.sh` script to build and run certain targets.  
### Windows (and other)
The build is currently untested on windows, but you could probably make it work with `cmake`. There is currently nothing worth releasing a demo build for, check back soon.
